    <h1>Garrett Saiki </h1>
    
    <p> I am a former biology major who decided to not attend med school because I realized it wasn't something I was passionate about. If you had a doctor, wouldn't you want them to be passionate about helping you? I want to make my mark on the world and experience a wealth of cultures. As a technical communications major, I can reach different people, grow and learn everyday. </p>
