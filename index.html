<p id=’firstId’>
I was born in Japan and adopted by a Japanese dad and Irish mom. Growing up I was involved in a lot of activities like boy scouts, karate, football, piano, and baseball. Baseball was actually my best sport growing up, while football would be a sport I ended up going to college for. Baseball allowed me to experience traveling a lot when I was younger as from 4th grade on we played in a California league on weekends and traveled to Omaha, Boston, Palm Springs, Tulsa, and San Antonio...along with Seattle, CDA, and local areas to play in baseball tournaments.

When I got older and hit high school I stopped playing baseball because a coach wouldn't let me be on varsity as a freshman, and I could letter in track. Sometimes I regret it, as every single kid I played with got drafted or played college ball, but me and the other kid who quit both ended up with football scholarships then getting hurt. In the end I am where I am, so it's all about making the best of my situation and where I have ended up.
